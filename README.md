# Waste-Management-SDG
This project was done while doing internship with the ITM, working with UN SDG programme for 2030.
This report is about using the data fetched from the world bank, iTM data server
and Foursquare API. From this data we will try to find out the cleanest cities
around the world because in the world bank SDG (Sustainable development
Goals) Climate change and Environment protection is one of the major indicators
and issues currently facing many countries. We will discuss further about the
climate change, waste management at various geo-locations and the logic that I
used was — if there exists a clean city then it is has a highly efficient waste
management facilities and there will be strong and successful management
practices behind it and those management practices will be governed by strong
pro-environmental and socially-committed rules and policies.
Calgary is one of example of such cities, which is considered as world’s cleanest
city by the United Nations and various international reports.
They are getting the number one position in the lieu of this category because of
their waste management practices performed by the authorities.
We will adopt such a model to conduct the similar search and find the
neighbourhood location which can give us the scientific locations to set up the
waste management units and process the cities waste without/minimal causing
any harm to the city.
